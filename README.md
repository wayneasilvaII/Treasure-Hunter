1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, I was given starter code that provided the environment, maze structure, and basic agent/game setup. I created the training logic for the pirate intelligent agent, including the reinforcement learning loop and Q-learning updates. I also wrote the pseudocode section, adjusted training parameters, and tested different configurations to balance exploration and exploitation. These changes allowed the agent to learn from experience, improve decision-making, and find the treasure more efficiently.
2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems by designing algorithms, building systems, and applying computational thinking to real-world challenges. This matters because their work impacts nearly every industry by creating tools that improve efficiency, uncover insights from data, and make technology more accessible. Reinforcement learning, as seen in this project, is a valuable example of how computer science can model decision making and adapt to complex environments, which has applications in robotics, healthcare, finance, and beyond.
3. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces. In this project, I first defined the environment and rules of the game, then identified the possible states and actions, and finally implemented the Q-learning algorithm to improve performance over time. This step-by-step, structured process ensures that even complex problems can be tackled logically, tested iteratively, and improved systematically.
4. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include ensuring that systems are safe, fair, transparent, and secure. For the end user, this means avoiding bias in algorithms, protecting privacy, and designing solutions that provide clear benefits without unintended harm. For organizations, it means building solutions that are not only effective but also ethically sound, sustainable, and aligned with professional standards. In reinforcement learning applications, this includes responsibly handling training data, clearly communicating system limitations, and preventing misuse of the technology.
